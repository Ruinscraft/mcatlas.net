			<h1>MCATLAS Rules</h1>
			<div style="text-align: left; z-index: 100; position: relative">
				<h3>General</h3>
				<ol id="rule-list">
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Do not use client-side cheats or hacks (includes autoclickers, X-ray texture packs, etc.). You may use mods that do not provide a large advantage in gameplay (Optifine, minimaps, etc.)</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Do not exploit any server-side bugs. <a href="https://discord.gg/srSSSgJ">Report them!</a></li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Do not attempt to lag or cause harm to the server.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">No inappropriate/NSFW material (including builds, chat, books, Town names, etc). Includes swearing. Keep it PG-13.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Do not post racist, homophobic, or other inflammatory speech (in chat, on signs, in books, etc).</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Do not attempt to bypass the chat filter.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">No harassing or bullying other players.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">No spamming the chat. This means sending several successive messages (more than two) with the same or similar content. This could also mean sending the same character, word, or phrase several times over within the same message.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Do not advertise other servers or products.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Do not evade or attempt to evade a ban or mute.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Do not sell in game currency or items for real money.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Builds</h3>
				<ol id="rule-list">
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Do not significantly alter or destroy the surface of the world. You can smoothen a hill, but don't blow up Mount Everest.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Do not build unrealistic structures (sky islands, floating Towns, underwater cities, etc).</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Do not build lavacasts, unless it is used for a smooth wall or something similarly controlled.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Do not create artificial islands. Realistic ocean builds, such as oil rigs or ships, are allowed.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Do not block waterways. You may build bridges; at least a 2 block gap between the surface of the water and the bottom of the bridge must be left so boats may easily pass underneath.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Do not build bridges more than 4 blocks wide across large oceans or bays. Typically, ice bridges with side walls or railroad bridges are a good idea.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Griefing and Theft</h3>
				<ol id="rule-list">
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Griefing is not allowed.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Griefing of unclaimed railways, paths, grinders, portals, hubs, etc. is not allowed (this includes in the Nether). You may alter these builds if you can claim them.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">If a build is seemingly abandoned, has no claims to it, and is not near another claim, you may claim/loot/destroy it. If it looks like it's part of a nearby Town, don't touch it!</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Griefing a seemingly abandoned build in an ugly way (lava, fire, random blocks, etc.) is not allowed.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Theft of items (from chests) is discouraged but allowed. Town or Nation bank theft is easily provable and will result in heavy punishment. Ensure you lock your chests to prevent item theft by placing a sign on them.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Theft or killing of mobs within towns is not allowed.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Theft of items by killing a player not properly warned of PvP is not allowed.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Towny (Towns and Nations)</h3>
				<ol id="rule-list">
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Towns can be named anything, but we recommend naming them after real life places. If you go to Chicago, you expect to see Chicago, not EpicBurgerTown.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Nations must be named after a formerly or currently existing nation, territory, major geographical feature, or large city in real life. You can add titles such as "Empire" to the name.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Towns and Nation names shouldn't be so similar to another Town or Nation that someone could be confused between them. ("Britain" vs. "GreatBritain")</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">A Nation's name must be relevant to the Nation's capital's location.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">You may only have up to 2 alternate accounts in Towns (not including a main account). An alternate account cannot be the mayor of a town.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Do not create a Town or claim land close to another Town just to block the other Town's growth. You are allowed to expand near/next to it if given permission by the original Town. Don't go out of your way to claim near their Town!</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Odd Town claims, including large unfilled outlines or disconnected singular claims, are discouraged. Staff have the discretion to remove these claims if they are in a high demand area, are unused, or have a poor appearance on the map.</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>PvP</h3>
				<ol id="rule-list">
					<li class="rule-list-entry">If you're not in a PvP enabled area, don't use other methods (lava, making a new claim, etc.) to kill someone.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Towns must give at least a 15 second warning to nearby users before enabling PvP.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Killing or attacking anybody without a fair warning of the fight is not allowed. If a Town already has PvP enabled or you are in the Nether/End, that is also a fair warning.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Do not trap a player so that they could never escape by themselves (portal traps, bed traps, etc.).</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Do not lure a player into being "spawn killed." AKA tricking someone to teleporting somewhere in order to kill them.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">Logging out in a potential PvP situation ("combat logging") is not allowed.</li>
					<li class="rule-list-entry">If a staff member is performing staff duties, do not attack them.</li>
